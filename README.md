# Weather App â›…

Yet another weather forecast app, built in React, with a design strongly inspired by [Abdullah Sajol](https://dribbble.com/abdullahsajol) on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16361858-Weather-Forecast-Mobile-application).

Please note this application is just a personal work to improve and learn new technologies.
